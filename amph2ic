description: The Division of Reptiles and Amphibians maintains a collection that is worldwide in scope. Presently, the research collections contain 197,469 (through catalogue number UMMZ 242,000) catalogued lots representing 433,505 individual specimens. These represent 1,067 genera and 5,323 species of which 13,818 specimens are skeletons. 99.9% of specimens are identified to genus, and 96% of specimens are identified to species. This includes 472 Primary Type specimens (representing 424 taxa) and 5,515 Paratypes (representing 804 taxa). The average growth over the last ten years has been nearly 1500 specimens per year. The auxiliary research collections contain 2,145 radiographs, 7,288 kodachrome slides, and 10,789 frozen tissue samples. All of the above mentioned collections have been inventoried and the data associated with them have been entered into computer databases in Filemaker Pro. A collection of 37 audio tapes containing hundreds of recordings of anuran vocalizations has been digitized and can now be accessed via the Division's webpage, as well as catalogue records and digital images of all primary type specimens.
