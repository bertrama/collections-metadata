Questions
---------

1. Are there any records that shouldn't be created?

    * How can I figure out which those are?

2. If a title is changed, should I put the old title in "other titles"
   (I'm currently doing that).

3. If there's an existing brief description, should I trust that as better
   than the possibly truncated 1st sentence?

   Consider Digital General Collection (genpub) as an example why I shouldn't.
   Lots of examples of why I should.

4. If there's an ST type listed that isn't Text Collection, Images, or Catalog,
   should I retain it?

   For example: Amphibian and Reptile Audio Files (amph2ic),
   Abraham Lincon Association Serials (alajournals)
