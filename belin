description: Volume 12- (2005-). Open to the world.|Each year since 1991, the Jean & Samuel Frankel Center for Judaic|Studies at the University of Michigan has brought a prestigious scholar to campus to address diverse dimensions of American Jewish culture. The lecture was established through a generous gift from the late David W. Belin, an alumnus of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, the Business School, and the Law School of the University of Michigan. This project is the published lectures of the David W. Belin Lecture in American Jewish Affairs.
