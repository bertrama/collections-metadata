description: The Michigan Ethnic Directory, the fifth edition since 1973, is a living and ever-developing document. It owes its existence to the work of tens of thousands of Michiganders who have organized and continue to breathe life into the thousands of ethnic organizations and to the hundreds who helped us compile this and earlier Ethnic Directories.This resource has not been updated since 2000. At this time, there are no plans to do so in the future.
